# Building a Youtube Clone

## Tools
I used just Html and Css for this project.

## About the Project
I had so much fun working on this project as it exposed me to almost all the different properties of CSS and Html.

I understand the concepts of
- Grids
- Flexboxes
- Responsive Designs
- Positioning
- Style Sheets
- Importing Images
- Links
- Advanced Css Properties
- Html Elements
- Interactivity
- Animations 
And So much more

## Challenge
This is a static design. It is not in anyway interactive yet, as Javascript hasn't been implemented. 

## Future
My Next projects is building an interactive YouTube Website using the full JavaScript Family.
